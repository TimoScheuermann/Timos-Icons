# Timo's Icons

# Version History

The history can be found either [here on GitHub](https://github.com/TimoScheuermann/Timos-Icons/releases) or on my dedicated [newsroom](https://newsroom.timos.design/project/Timo's%20Icons)

## Getting started

### Variant 1
**Include single icons via svg**
To use a single icon in your project, click on the "Copy SVG" button of the desired icon and paste it into your project

### Variant 2
**Include the whole library from version X**

To insert all icons from a certain version on, first choose a version and then add the following link to your <head>

```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TimoScheuermann/Timos-Icons@X/public/resources/style.css```

replace the X with your chosen version. Now the icons can be used in your project via a <i class="ti-{icon name}" />. Alternatively you can use the "Copy HTML" button to generate the i-tag.
